# Advent of Code 2020
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) programming puzzles, written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

This was my third Advent of Code and the first one I did "live", starting on December 1st and generally trying to complete each puzzle on the day it was released.

I used this as an opportunity to refine my Rust language skills. My goals were:
1. Solve the puzzles in a reasonably robust way.
    * Create solutions that were "general enough", such that any reasonable input would be solved by the program. In some cases it would be prohibitively difficult to make a truly general solution and the input data showed clear intent to not require one, then some shortcuts were acceptable.
    * Create programs with good structure. Use structs, mods, and composition.
    * Follow best practices by writing unit tests wherever it benefited the process of solving the puzzle. Typically, any important functionality with non-trivial edge cases would be tested.
    * Documentation was not a priority. I made no effort to add comments describing the overall solution, nor the individual functions. Comments were added only where it helped the writing process. In a real life production environment comments and good documentation would of course be required.
2. Write idiomatic Rust code wherever possible.
    * The code compiles with no warnings, has no clippy warnings (see below), and conforms to the Rust formatting guidelines.
    * Use only features of the latest version of stable Rust.
    * No unsafe code.
3. Learn or practice features of the Rust language where the solutions present an opportunity, even if it's not the ideal fit for the situation.
4. Create efficient solutions. In the end I set a goal to have all solutions execute within 2 seconds total, which I achieved (see below). I usually chose good structure over optimization, but for days when the solution took a long time to run the optimization became a priority.
5. Practice writing parsers using the nom crate.
6. Use few external crates, relying mainly on the standard library.

# Building and running
This project uses the [Cargo AoC](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) framework, which must be installed in order to build the program. Cargo AoC  makes it easy to download input files and supply them to the program, separate generators and solvers, and execute solutions selectively. It also provides an easy way to benchmark solutions.

All solutions can be tested and run with the usual cargo commands:
* `cargo test`
* `cargo run --release`

The solutions can be selectively run as follows:
* `cargo aoc -d D`, where D is replaced with the relevant day number (1-25)
* `cargo aoc -d D -p P`, same as above but replacing P with the relevant part number (1-2)

## Clippy
The clippy linter does not produce any warnings on the code at the default warning levels, with few exceptions where it is suppressed:
* `clippy::bool_comparison` and `clippy::needless_bool` - I find it far more readable to explicitly write booleans in most places they are used

## Commit hook
Each commit is checked with the following commands:
* `cargo fmt -- --check`
* `cargo test`
* `cargo clean -p advent_of_code_2020; cargo clippy -- -Dwarnings`

# Execution times
After completing the puzzles I measured the execution times of each solution and performed some optimization in order to reduce total execution time. This year most of my initial solutions completed in less than 1 ms, so the bulk of the optimization was done on those days that were significantly longer.

Time measurements were made using the command: `cargo aoc bench -d 1`, where 1 is replaced with the relevant day number. The average measurement was used; in some cases it would be more accurate to use the fastest measurement as this best represents how the program is capable of performing, however in other cases there is significant variability in the run time due to the program itself (such as when using hashes, which internally have random seeds).

Originally the measurements were taken on a PC built in 2012. Since then I took a new set of measurements on a PC built in 2021 to compare against modern hardware.

Totals:
* Old hardware: **1.9098 s**
* New hardware: **811.30 ms**
